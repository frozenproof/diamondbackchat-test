# What took so long ?
You look at an app and wonder , what the fuck is causing issues and taking so long to update .

Well , as it turns out , everyone try to one up each other , which cause incompatibility issue .

These issues can come from very simple upgrade to system, which is supposed to make it run better , but what it does is simply removing older codes which break everything built upon those codes .

Many improvements don't even rely on those certain breaking changes , but is bundled anyways because it's stressful to just decide what to display , if you show everything , people will steal it and put it under a different name to get all the supposed benefits .


# Issue
- Postgres is required due to changes in pricing model.




# About env file
